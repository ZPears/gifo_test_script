# Instructions

1. Clone this repository from the home dir using `git clone https://github.com/ZPears/gifo_test_script.git`
2. Go into the cloned repository: `cd ~/gifo_test_script`
3. Install dependencies (just the GPIO library): `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start program: `python test.py`
5. Press buttons and see if there's any output to the console.

# Notes

Note that in [this documentation link for the GPIO library](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html#pin-numbering), the software numbering for the pins is not the same as the hardware pin numbers. So do not worry about discrepancies there.
